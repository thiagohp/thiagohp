## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thiago Henrique de Paula Figueiredo, someone who loves software development and open source.

I'm an [Apache Tapestry](https://tapestry.apache.org) committer, PMC member and PMC chair. I'm also
the owner of [Machina Tecnologia da InformaÃ§Ã£o Ltda](https://github.com/machina-br).

You can sponsor my Tapestry work through GitHub Sponsors at

My avatar is a [pÃ£o de queijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A3o_de_queijo)),
which is the most typical food from the Minas Gerais state, Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, where I was born and have been
living almost my whole life.
